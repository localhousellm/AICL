⚠️ Important Notice — Current Version Limitations & Upcoming AICL-X Update

This release of AICL (v1.0.0) is fully functional for development, but it contains one known limitation:

❗Known Issue: Import Resolution Bug (ModuleRegistry import error)

The current package layout (AICL/ inside site-packages) may cause:
ImportError: cannot import name 'ModuleRegistry' from 'AICL.registry'

This occurs because the internal module structure and the Python package layout are not fully aligned yet.
Functionality is intact, but certain from AICL import ... imports may fail depending on environment.

A hotfix version will address this with:
Corrected import paths
Unified lowercase package namespace (aicl)
Backward compatibility
Clean, PEP-440 compliant install structure
Automated module discovery

Expected fix release: v1.0.1
🚧 Upcoming Major Update — AICL-X (Extended Symbol Language)
The next version (AICL-X) introduces the full symbolic communication language designed for modular AI:

AICL-X will include:

A new AICL Symbol Language (AICL-SL)
Complete operator taxonomy (OP:MUL, OP:CLS, OP:RSN, etc.)
String blocks (S:"...") and token dictionaries
Compressed packet mode
Binary codec (optional)
Backward-compatible Packet API
A formal grammar specification
This update will transform AICL from a routing layer into a full AI-native communication protocol, powering ANVIRA and future modular LLM systems.

🔮 What Users Should Expect

✔ v1.0.x

Fixes, stability, and proper pip import behavior.

✔ v1.1.x

Introduction of the AICL Symbol Language and encoder/decoder.

✔ v2.x

Binary AICL, inter-process adapters, and deeper ANVIRA compatibility.

🙏 Thank You



# AICL — Adaptive Inter-Module Communication Language
### High-Performance Communication Protocol for Modular AI Systems

## 🚀 Overview

AICL (Adaptive Inter-Module Communication Language) is a **high-performance symbolic communication protocol** designed for modular AI architectures — including ANVIRA, AMA-MRL, hierarchical agent systems, distributed reasoning engines, and model-agnostic AI pipelines.

AICL enables AI modules to:

- Communicate using a **compact symbolic language**  
- Exchange structured messages with **zero ambiguity**  
- Route tasks dynamically with **high concurrency**  
- Enforce safety rules and policies  
- Register, orchestrate, and monitor modules cleanly  

AICL functions as the **nervous system** of an AI, connecting reasoning units, safety layers, translators, memory systems, and self-learning modules.

## 📦 Features

### 📨 AICL Packet System
- Efficient symbolic message format  
- Intent, confidence, metadata, and tracing baked in  
- Self-validating packets with error reporting  
- Merge & transform operations  
- AI-friendly minimal overhead design  

### 🔀 Router
- Concurrent dispatch (sync + async modules)  
- Directed routing / broadcast / multicast  
- Timeout, retry, and backoff support  
- Pre-route and post-route safety hooks  
- Async inbox system for worker modules  

### 📚 Registry
- Persistent module registry  
- Metadata, capabilities, and health status  
- Automatic integrity checks  
- JSON or DB storage adapters  

### 🛡 Safety System
- Rule-based packet validation  
- Blocking, mutation, or passthrough modes  
- System-wide safety enforcement  
- Rogue module protection  

### 🧰 Utility Helpers
- High-precision timestamps  
- UUID-based packet IDs  
- Freeze / unfreeze utilities  
- Zero extra dependencies

## 🔧 Installation

### From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/localhousellm/AICL.git
cd AICL

(Future) PyPI:
pip install aicl


🧪 Minimal Example
Creating and sending a packet
from AICL import AICLPacket, Router

router = Router()

def echo(pkt):
    return AICLPacket(
        origin="echo",
        symbols=[f"Echo: {pkt.symbols}"]
    )

router.register_module("echo_module", echo)

p = AICLPacket(origin="user", symbols=["hello", "world"])
resp = router.request_response(p, target="echo_module")

print(resp.pretty())


🛡 Safety Example
from AICL import SafetyRules, SafetyViolation

rules = SafetyRules()

# Block packets containing a forbidden keyword
rules.add_rule(
    lambda p: "forbidden" not in p.symbols
    or SafetyViolation("Forbidden term detected")
)

packet = AICLPacket(origin="test", symbols=["this", "is", "forbidden"])

try:
    rules.enforce(packet)
except SafetyViolation as v:
    print("Blocked:", v)

🔌 Example Module Adapter
handler = Router.make_module_adapter_from_callable(
    lambda text: text.upper(),
    name="upper_module"
)

router.register_module("upper", handler)
